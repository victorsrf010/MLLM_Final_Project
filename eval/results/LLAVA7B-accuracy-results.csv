February Sales Turnover = (January Sales Turnover \* (1 + Target Growth Rate)) / 100

Plugging in the values, we get:

February Sales Turnover = (£274,299 \* (1 + 0.015)) / 100

To calculate the difference between the target and the actual Leisure profits, we can subtract the target from the actual Leisure profits.

Target: 1/4 of total profits
Actual Leisure profits: £1.8 million

So, the difference between the target and the actual Leisure profits is:

Target - Actual = (1/4) x (£1.8 million - £1.8 million) = -£1.8 million

Since the target was to have Leisure profits be a quarter of their total profits, the actual Leisure profits missed the target by -£1.8 million.

The shaft is connected to a device that requires rotation.

The correct statement is (C) A and C turn clockwise and B turns anticlockwise. The image shows that the belt is connected to two pulleys, one on the left side and one on the right side. The pulley on the left side is connected to a motor, while the pulley on the right side is connected to a shaft. The belt moves around both pulleys, causing the shaft to rotate in the opposite direction. The pulley on the left side rotates in the clockwise direction, while the pulley on the right side rotates in the anticlockwise direction. This arrangement allows the device connected to the shaft to rotate in the desired direction.",0
